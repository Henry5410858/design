# ⚡ 5-Minute Deployment Checklist

## 📋 Before You Start

- [ ] Have Render dashboard open (backend)
- [ ] Have Netlify dashboard open (frontend)
- [ ] Know your exact Netlify domain (from browser address bar)
- [ ] Know your exact Render backend URL

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Get Your URLs (1 minute)

### Netlify Frontend URL
Open your app in browser → look at address bar
```
https://design-dispute.netlify.app  ← This is your FRONTEND URL
```

**Copy this value**: `_________________________________`

### Render Backend URL
Render Dashboard → Services → Your Backend → Look for "Service URL" at top
```
https://design-backend-6vx4.onrender.com  ← This is your BACKEND URL
```

**Copy this value**: `_________________________________`

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Update Backend on Render (2 minutes)

**Location**: Render Dashboard → Your Service → Environment

### Add/Update These Variables:

```
FRONTEND_URL
Value: [PASTE YOUR NETLIFY URL HERE]


CORS_ORIGINS
Value: [PASTE YOUR NETLIFY URL HERE]
```

**Keep all other variables unchanged** (MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.)

### Save Changes:
- [ ] Click "Save"
- [ ] Wait for backend to redeploy (watch status indicator)

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Update Frontend on Netlify (2 minutes)

**Location**: Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables

### Add This Variable:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
Value: [PASTE YOUR RENDER URL HERE]
```

### Save and Redeploy:
- [ ] Click "Save"
- [ ] Go to "Deploys" section
- [ ] Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (shows "Published")

---

## ✅ Step 4: Test Login (1 minute)

1. [ ] Open your Netlify app in browser
2. [ ] Go to login page
3. [ ] Open DevTools Console (F12)
4. [ ] Enter test credentials
5. [ ] Watch console for logs

### ✅ Success Indicators:
Look for these messages in console:
```
🔐 Login: Attempting authentication with backend at: https://[your-backend].onrender.com
🔐 Login: User authenticated: [username]
```

### ❌ Failure Indicators:
```
🚫 CORS blocked  → Check FRONTEND_URL on Render
❌ Backend unreachable → Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL on Netlify
Invalid credentials → Check username/password
```

### Backend Unreachable?
- [ ] Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is set on Netlify
- [ ] Paste exact Render URL (from Render dashboard)
- [ ] Redeploy Netlify frontend
